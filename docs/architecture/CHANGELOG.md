## [Unreleased]

### Multi-Device Enhancements (November 24, 2025)
- **Short URL System:**
  - Added `shortId` field to Player interface (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
  - QR codes now use short URLs: `?p=P1` instead of `?playerId=player_1763967154004_92v28yshl`
  - Backward compatible with old URL format
  - URL length reduced by ~90% for easier manual entry

- **Display Settings Feature:**
  - New GameDisplaySettings component for per-player panel visibility control
  - Available during both SETUP and PLAY phases
  - Connection status badges show mobile vs desktop connections
  - localStorage persistence for settings across sessions
  - Quick preset buttons: "Show All Panels" and "Hide Connected Only"
  - Addresses accessibility concerns for mixed-device scenarios (computer labs)

- **Layout Optimization:**
  - Automatically hide player panel column when all panels are hidden
  - Game board expands to 100% width when no panels visible
  - Improved space efficiency for all-remote player scenarios
  - Smart default behavior: hide panels for connected players, show for disconnected

- **Device Detection Improvements:**
  - Support both mobile and desktop connection detection
  - Proper badge labels for each device type
  - Enhanced GameDisplaySettings with device-specific suggestions
  - Fixed display logic to handle both connection types

- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/types/DataTypes.ts` - Added shortId to Player interface
  - `src/services/StateService.ts` - Generate short player IDs
  - `src/utils/networkDetection.ts` - Short URL support
  - `src/utils/getAppScreen.ts` - Handle both URL formats
  - `src/App.tsx` - Updated device detection for short URLs
  - `src/components/layout/GameLayout.tsx` - Display settings + layout optimization
  - `src/components/settings/GameDisplaySettings.tsx` - New component
  - `src/components/setup/PlayerList.tsx` - Use short URLs in QR codes
  - `docs/project/TODO.md` - Added multi-game session support task

- **Branch Cleanup:**
  - Deleted superseded branches: debug-stuck-session, fix-qr-player-routing, smart-layout-adaptation
  - Main work consolidated in claude/server-state-sync-015vguQHiYncpGAGktxqnAPQ

### Smart Layout Adaptation - Architecture Redesign (November 19, 2025)
- **Problem Identified:**
  - Initial implementation used continuous heartbeat polling (every 3 seconds)
  - Backend session tracking with 10-second timeout caused flickering
  - Player panels would disappear and reappear as sessions expired/recreated
  - Overengineered solution for a simple problem

- **Solution Implemented:**
  - **Removed:** Heartbeat polling loop, session tracking, timeout logic
  - **Added:** `deviceType?: 'mobile' | 'desktop'` field to Player interface (DataTypes.ts:170)
  - **Approach:** One-time device detection when player connects via QR code URL
  - Device type stored permanently in player state, synchronized via existing state sync

- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/types/DataTypes.ts` - Added deviceType to Player interface
  - `src/App.tsx` - Replaced heartbeat loop with one-time detection on URL param presence
  - `src/components/layout/GameLayout.tsx` - Removed session polling, uses player.deviceType directly
  - `SMART_LAYOUT_ADAPTATION.md` - Updated documentation to reflect new architecture

- **Benefits:**
  - No polling overhead during gameplay
  - No flickering issues
  - Simpler, more maintainable architecture
  - State persists across browser refreshes
  - Leverages existing state sync infrastructure

### Movement System Refactor & Cleanup (November 14, 2025)
- **CSV-Based Movement System Refactor:**
  - Fixed REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW data corruption (LOGIC movement now returns valid space names, not question text)
  - Fixed dice detection false positives (41 → 18 dice spaces, game no longer stuck at start)
  - Implemented pathChoiceMemory for REG-DOB-TYPE-SELECT (DOB path choice now locked per regulations)
  - Enhanced is_valid_space_name() validation with stricter regex patterns
  - Implemented path-first decision tree in data/process_game_data.py
  - Fixed OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION movement type (fixed → OWNER-FUND-INITIATION, not dice)
  - All validation checks passing (0 errors, valid space names only)

- **Post-Refactor Cleanup:**
  - Restored regression tests: ButtonNesting.regression.test.tsx (7 tests), CardCountNaN.regression.test.tsx (7 tests)
  - Added pathChoiceMemory test coverage (7 new unit tests in MovementService.test.ts)
  - Reorganized 9 root-level .md files to docs/archive/ for better organization
  - Identified 6 merged remote branches for cleanup
  - All 39 MovementService tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Total new/restored test coverage: 21 tests

### Bug Fixes (November 7, 2025)
- **CSV Format & Data Fixes:**
  - Fixed CARDS_EXPANDED.csv missing `work_type_restriction` column (22nd column required by DataService parser)
  - Fixed L003 "New Safety Regulations" card data: `discard_cards` field changed from "1" to "1 E" to specify card type
  - Improved E2E-05 test error logging to show specific CSV parsing failures for easier diagnosis
  - All E2E-05 multi-player effect tests now passing (4/4 tests)

- **UI Improvements from Claude Code Web:**
  - Merged animation system (animations.css, animationConstants.ts) for smooth UI transitions
  - Standardized modal layouts using centralized theme constants
  - Unified button styling across all components
  - Added UI style guide documentation (docs/UI_STYLE_GUIDE.md)
  - Resolved modal styling conflicts (DiceResultModal, ChoiceModal) by adopting theme-based approach

### Refactoring (November 5, 2025)
- **Project Scope System Refactoring:**
  - Migrated project scope from a player field to a calculated value based on W (Work) cards
  - Implemented `GameRulesService.calculateProjectScope()` as single source of truth for scope calculation
  - Updated all scope-based condition evaluation (scope_le_4M, scope_gt_4M) to use W cards
  - Removed deprecated `player.projectScope` field throughout the codebase
  - Fixed PROJECT SCOPE section in UI to show actual scope totals instead of $0
  - **Test Fixes:** Fixed 10 test failures across MovementService, TurnService, and ManualFunding test suites
    - Updated MovementService tests to inject `gameRulesService` dependency
    - Updated TurnService OWNER-FUND-INITIATION tests to use W cards instead of deprecated field
    - Updated ManualFunding tests to properly initialize game state and inject mocks
  - All 69 refactoring-related tests now passing (100% success rate)

### Refactoring (October 21, 2025)
- **Console Log Cleanup:**
  - Removed 51 verbose debugging console logs (18% reduction) from key files:
    - `NextStepButton.tsx`: 25 → 1 log (96% reduction)
    - `StateService.ts`: 46 → 40 logs (13% reduction)
    - `TurnService.ts`: 168 → 154 logs (8% reduction)
    - `TurnControls.tsx` (LEGACY): 51 → 44 logs (14% reduction)
  - Removed verbose function entry/exit logs, duplicate state notifications, and object dumps
  - Kept all `console.error()` and `console.warn()` statements for error handling
  - Kept strategic movement and card operation logs for ongoing development work
  - All 256 tests passing after cleanup (no functionality broken)

### Bug Fixes (October 21, 2025)
- **Test Suite Stabilization:**
  - Fixed ~105 failing tests across `TurnService`, `TimeSection`, `CardsSection`, `FinancesSection`, and `NextStepButton`.
  - Refactored `CardDetailsModal` and `DiscardedCardsModal` to use props-based Dependency Injection (DI).
  - Rewrote 4 `NextStepButton` tests (loading state) using a simplified approach.
- **`CHEAT-BYPASS` Space Bug Fix:**
  - Resolved an issue where the "Roll to Move" button on `CHEAT-BYPASS` did not lead to movement, and the `ChoiceModal` presented incorrect options.
  - Implemented a multi-phase fix addressing missing `dice_outcome` handling, `MovementService.validateMove()` issues, and multiple sources of incorrect `ChoiceModal` generation.
  - The `CHEAT-BYPASS` space now correctly presents a single, dice-determined destination via a `ChoiceModal`, allows the player to select it, and successfully moves the player with appropriate notifications.

### Features
- **Player Panel UI Refactor (October 12, 2025):**
  - Replaced the static player panel with a dynamic, component-based system using individual section components (e.g., `FinancesSection`, `TimeSection`, `CardsSection`).
  - Implemented a three-column header layout (Title, Actions, Summary) for all panel sections to improve information density and usability on all screen sizes.
  - Action buttons are now centered in the header and always visible.
  - Section summary text is now right-aligned for better readability.
  - Implemented an "exclusive accordion" for the Cards section, where opening one card type collapses others.
  - Iteratively refined UI spacing and button padding based on user feedback for a tighter, more compact design.

### Features (October 13, 2025)
- **Journey Timeline Enhancement:**
  - Added detailed visit tracking with days spent per space
  - Implemented `SpaceVisitRecord` interface to track entry/exit times and duration
  - Updated `TimeSection` to display days spent badges (e.g., "5d") for previously visited spaces
  - `MovementService` now automatically calculates and records time spent when leaving spaces
  - Backward compatible with existing saved games using the legacy `visitedSpaces` array

- **E Card Usability Features:**
  - Added visual phase restriction indicators for E cards based on current space phase
  - Implemented "Play Card" button for E cards that are currently playable
  - Added phase validation badges (green ✓ for playable, red ✗ for restricted cards)
  - Added helpful restriction messages explaining when cards can be used
  - Checks card `phase_restriction` field against current space's phase from GameConfig
  - Supports phase types: DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, FUNDING, REGULATORY, or "Any"

### Bug Fixes
- **Critical `End Turn` Bug (October 12, 2025):**
  - Fixed a game-breaking bug in the `NextStepButton` component where it was calling the wrong service method (`turnService.endTurn()` instead of `turnService.endTurnWithMovement()`), preventing the game from advancing to the next player.

- **Card Money Sources Bug (October 13, 2025):**
  - Fixed bug in `CardService` where B (Bank) and I (Investment) cards were not adding money when played
  - Root cause: Code was checking for non-existent `loan_amount` and `investment_amount` CSV fields
  - Solution: Updated to use the correct `cost` field from Cards.csv with proper type checking
  - Money now correctly flows through `ResourceService` and appears in `moneySources.bankLoans` or `moneySources.investmentDeals`

- **Get Funding Button Handler (October 13, 2025):**
  - Fixed "Get Funding" button at `OWNER-FUND-INITIATION` space not triggering funding
  - Root cause: Button was calling `onRollDice` handler instead of dedicated funding handler
  - Solution: Added `onAutomaticFunding` prop chain from GameLayout → PlayerPanel → FinancesSection
  - Button now correctly calls `TurnService.handleAutomaticFunding()` to provide an automatic, direct cash deposit (seed money) based on project scope.

- **Movement Choice Premature Turn End Bug (October 16, 2025):**
  - Fixed bug where players could end their turn on decision spaces (like PM-DECISION-CHECK) before completing all required actions
  - Root cause 1: Movement intent wasn't being set when player selected a destination, so `moveIntent` was null at turn end
  - Root cause 2: `TurnControlsWithActions.tsx` had logic that incorrectly allowed ending turn immediately after selecting a movement destination
  - Solution 1: Added `setPlayerMoveIntent()` calls in `TurnService.handleMovementChoices()` and `restoreMovementChoiceIfNeeded()`
  - Solution 2: Removed the `movementChoice && selectedDestination !== null` bypass from `hasCompletedPrimaryAction` logic
  - Players now must complete all required actions (dice roll + manual effects) before ending turn on decision spaces

### Features (October 18, 2025)
- **Card Feedback Modal Enhancements:**
  - DiceResultModal now displays the actual names of cards drawn/removed/replaced (e.g., "Market Research", "New plumbing systems")
  - Card names appear below effect summaries in italics for better readability
  - Extended modal coverage to ALL card operations:
    - Dice rolls with card effects (already working, now enhanced with names)
    - Automatic funding at OWNER-FUND-INITIATION (now shows modal)
    - Manual card draws (Draw E cards, Draw W cards, etc. now show modals)
  - Added `data.cardIds` field to `EffectResult` for passing card IDs from Effect Engine
  - Added `cardIds` field to `DiceResultEffect` for modal display
  - Implemented callback chain: CardsSection → PlayerPanel → GameLayout for manual effect modals
  - Clear visual distinction: draw (+), remove (-), replace (↔) symbols

### Refactoring (October 16, 2025)
- **Data-Driven Space Configuration:**
  - Added `special_action` field to `SpaceContent` interface for future special space behaviors
  - Updated `DataService.parseSpaceContentCsv()` to parse `special_action` from SPACE_CONTENT.csv column 8
  - Removed hardcoded `OWNER-FUND-INITIATION` checks in `TurnControlsWithActions.tsx`:
    - `canRollDice` now uses `requiresManualDiceRoll` from GAME_CONFIG.csv instead of hardcoded space name
    - `hasCompletedPrimaryAction` now uses `!requiresManualDiceRoll` instead of checking space name
  - All space-specific behaviors now driven by CSV configuration rather than hardcoded logic
  - Improves maintainability and makes it easier to add new special spaces without code changes
