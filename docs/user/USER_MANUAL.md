## Tips & Strategies

### Resource Management

**Money:**
- Take loans early to fund permits and cards
- Bank loans (<$4M projects) have lower interest
- Investor loans (>$4M projects) for large projects
- Track loan balances in Finances section

**Time:**
- Minimize time to win
- Use E (Expeditor) cards to reduce time
- Avoid L (Life Event) cards that add time
- "Try Again" costs time but may save money

### Card Strategy

**Work (W) Cards:**
- Increase project scope
- Draw early to qualify for investor funding
- Required to finish game

**Expeditor (E) Cards:**
- Reduce permit processing time
- Most valuable for time optimization
- Can be transferred between players

**Life Event (L) Cards:**
- Usually negative effects
- Can be transferred to opponents (strategic!)
- Some have dice-based outcomes

### Movement Strategy

**Path Choices:**
- Some choices lock permanently (e.g., DOB type)
- Plan ahead before committing
- "Try Again" available on some spaces

**Dice Spaces:**
- **CHEAT spaces:** You actively roll the dice to try to cheat the system
- **REG spaces:** Dice rolls automatically (clerk/examiner makes the decision)
- Check DICE_OUTCOMES data for probabilities
- "Try Again" if outcome is unfavorable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Actions remaining" - can't end turn**
