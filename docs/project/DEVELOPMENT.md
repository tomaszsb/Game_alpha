## Session Summary: October 7, 2025

**Objective:** Resolve critical UI instability in the Player Panel, identify and architect a fix for a core gameplay logic bug, and plan a major new feature for data management.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Player Panel UI Overhaul:**
    *   **Identified Root Cause:** Diagnosed that the player panel's distracting resizing was caused by dynamic styling and layout properties changing on user interaction.
    *   **Iterative Solution:** Collaborated with Claude through several iterations to not only stabilize the panel but also implement a professional, responsive UI component (`ResponsiveSheet`) that acts as a modal on desktop and a native-style bottom sheet on mobile.
    *   **Standardization:** All pop-up panels (Financials, Card Portfolio, Space Explorer, etc.) were standardized to use this new, consistent component.

2.  **"Try Again" Logic Refactor:**
    *   **Architectural Flaw Identified:** Uncovered a brittle, bug-prone pattern in the `TurnService` that used a persistent `usedTryAgain` flag on the player state.
    *   **Verified the Flaw:** Performed a code trace to confirm the flag was handled inconsistently, with duplicate code in some places and missing logic in others.
    *   **Designed a Robust Solution:** Architected a new, cleaner approach that removes the persistent flag in favor of ephemeral UI-level state, passing a parameter to the `endTurnWithMovement` function instead. This improves stability and maintainability.
    *   **Tasked Implementation:** Delegated the implementation of this high-value refactor to Claude.

3.  **New Feature: Data Editor Scaffolding:**
    *   **Planned a New Feature:** Designed a user-friendly, form-based "Data Editor" for tweaking `Spaces.csv` data, based on user feedback.
    *   **Scaffolded the Component:** Created the initial `DataEditor.tsx` file and integrated it into the main `GameLayout.tsx` with a new persistent "Settings" icon.
    *   **Delegated Implementation:** Handed off the detailed implementation plan to Claude, to be executed after the "Try Again" refactor is complete.

**Outcome:** A major UI instability has been resolved with a professional-grade component. A critical architectural flaw in the game's core logic is being fixed. A major new feature has been planned and scaffolded for future development.

## ✅ **PHASE COMPLETION: IPC Communication System - Phase 2 Stabilization**
*Status: COMPLETED - October 7, 2025*

**Objective**: Transition from complex file-based polling system to industry-standard MCP IPC communication for AI-to-AI messaging.

- **✅ IPC System Deployment**: Implemented claude-ipc-mcp MCP server for cross-environment AI communication
- **✅ Documentation Update**: Updated CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md to reflect IPC-primary communication protocol
- **✅ System Simplification**: Deprecated file-based polling system (ai-bridge) as backup only
- **✅ Cross-Environment Support**: IPC system works across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other AI environments
- **✅ Communication Testing**: Verified bidirectional IPC messaging between Claude and Gemini

**Result**: Simplified, more reliable AI communication using industry-standard MCP approach. No more polling clients or manual archiving required.

---

## ✅ **PHASE COMPLETION: Unified AI Collaboration Manager (`gemini-collab.sh`)**
*Status: COMPLETED - October 5, 2025* (Deprecated: October 7, 2025)

**Objective**: Create a single, unified shell script to manage the lifecycle (start, stop, status) of both Claude's and Gemini's communication clients, further streamlining the developer experience.

- **✅ Script Creation**: Implemented `gemini-collab.sh` to orchestrate `ai-collab.sh` and `ai-collab-gemini.sh`.
- **✅ Unified Control**: Provides a single interface to start, stop, and check the status of both AI communication clients simultaneously.
- **✅ Robustness**: Leverages the individual client management scripts, ensuring correct working directories and PID handling.

**Result**: A centralized and efficient tool for managing the entire AI collaboration system, significantly enhancing operational ease.

**Note**: This system was deprecated in favor of IPC-based communication (October 7, 2025).

---

## ✅ **PHASE COMPLETION: AI Collaboration Manager Script (`ai-collab.sh`)**
*Status: COMPLETED - October 5, 2025*

**Objective**: Create a robust shell script to manage the lifecycle of AI communication clients (start, stop, status) as background processes, improving developer experience and communication reliability.

- **✅ Script Creation**: Implemented `ai-collab.sh` with `start`, `stop`, and `status` commands.
- **✅ Process Management**: Script correctly starts `mcp_client.py` in the background, saves PID, and gracefully terminates the process.
- **✅ Working Directory Handling**: Ensures `mcp_client.py` runs from the correct project root.
- **✅ Error Handling**: Includes checks for stale PID files and process existence.
- **✅ Line Ending Conversion**: Resolved issue with Windows line endings (`\r\n`) by converting the script to Unix format (`\n`).

**Result**: A reliable and user-friendly tool for managing AI communication clients, enhancing the overall developer experience.

## 🚀 **WORK IN PROGRESS: Robust Transactional Logging - September 28, 2025**

**Objective**: To refactor the game's logging system to be fully transactional, ensuring the final post-game log is a 100% accurate record of all committed player actions. This initiative will correct a flaw where the "Try Again" mechanic would leave aborted actions in the log, making it unreliable for student and teacher analysis. The new architecture will use a dual-layer logging system to logically separate committed and exploratory actions.

## 🎮 **GAME LOG AND TURN SEQUENCE OVERHAUL - September 25, 2025**

### ✅ **Phase Completion: Game Log UI/UX and Core Logic Refactor**
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Summary**: A deep, iterative refactoring of the entire game logging system and underlying turn sequence logic. This addressed critical bugs related to display, ordering, and gameplay sequence, resulting in a stable and intuitive game log.

### **Issues Addressed**
1.  **Incorrect Colors & Grouping**: Log entries were not using correct player colors and were not grouped by turn, making the log difficult to read.
2.  **Out-of-Sequence Events**: Critical gameplay logic was executing in the wrong order (e.g., arrival effects happening after player actions), causing confusion.
3.  **Duplicate & Missing Logs**: The log was cluttered with repetitive entries for a single action, while some manual actions were not being logged at all.

### **Architectural Changes Implemented**

1.  **Smart Logging Service (`LoggingService.ts`)**:
    - The `determineActionType` function was refactored to be "intelligent." It no longer relies on callers providing a perfect `action` type.
    - It now infers the correct log type by inspecting the content of the log message itself, providing a robust, centralized solution to type categorization.

2.  **Unified Turn-Start Logic (`TurnService.ts`)**:
    - The separate, buggy code path for the game's first turn was eliminated.
    - A single, unified `startTurn(playerId)` function was created to handle the beginning of *all* turns (first and subsequent).
    - This function now enforces the correct sequence of operations: **1. Lock UI -> 2. Save Snapshot -> 3. Process Arrival Effects -> 4. Unlock UI**.

3.  **Centralized Logging (`NotificationService.ts`, `CardService.ts`)**:
    - Redundant, low-level logging calls were removed from multiple services.
    - The system now follows a clearer pattern where higher-level services are responsible for initiating logs, resulting in a cleaner, de-duplicated log.

4.  **Data-Driven UI (`GameLog.tsx`)**:
    - The UI component was refactored to be purely data-driven.
    - It now correctly renders collapsible, color-coded, and properly ordered log groups based on the `type` of the log entries it receives.

### **Post-Refactor Fixes (September 27, 2025)**
- **First-Turn Unification**: The `startGame` logic was updated to use `placePlayersOnStartingSpaces`, which separates player placement from effect processing. This resolves the long-standing issue where the first turn's events were logged out of sequence. All turns now follow the same unified and correct lifecycle.
- **Log Sequencing**: Corrected the processing order to ensure player logs appear in the correct sequence and that the "entered space" log is always the first entry.
- **"Try Again" Logic**: Fixed a bug in the "Try Again" feature to ensure turn progression now correctly moves to the next player after the time penalty is applied.

## Session Summary: October 4, 2025

**Objective:** Resolve a series of critical bugs in the Game Log component and implement several UI/UX enhancements based on live Owner feedback.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Game Log Stability:** Diagnosed and resolved a complex chain of interconnected bugs that caused the Game Log to display incorrect or missing data. This involved:
    *   Debugging a persistent caching issue with the Vite development server.
    *   Correcting the data flow and property names (`space` vs. `spaceName`, `action` vs. `type`) between the backend services and the frontend component.
    *   Fixing an order-of-operations bug in `TurnService` to ensure correct per-player turn counting.
    *   Refactoring the `GameLog` component's data processing logic to be more robust and use the `turn_start` action as a definitive source of truth.

2.  **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   **Collapsible Log:** The entire Game Log panel is now hidden by default and can be toggled with a new button in the `ProjectProgress` header.
    *   **Visit Indicator:** The log now displays a `(1)` for a player's first visit to a space and an `(S)` for subsequent visits, adding valuable context.
    *   **Log Filtering:** Redundant "entered space" messages are now correctly filtered from the action list.

**Outcome:** The Game Log is now stable, accurate, and provides a better user experience. All identified bugs from the user testing session have been resolved.
