# Game Alpha - Construction Project Management Board Game

**Status:** Production Ready (November 2025)
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Test Coverage:** 958 tests passing across 91 test files (100% success rate)

## Overview

Game Alpha is a multi-player board game that simulates the construction project management process, from initial design through regulatory approval and construction. Players navigate through various spaces representing real-world construction phases, manage resources (money and time), collect cards representing work scope and regulatory requirements, and compete to complete their projects first.

Built with modern web technologies and a clean service-oriented architecture, the game supports both single-device and multi-device gameplay with real-time state synchronization.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone or navigate to the repository
cd /mnt/d/unravel/current_game/Game_Alpha

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Game
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend servers
npm run dev
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:3001
```

The `npm run dev` command automatically starts:
- **Vite dev server** (port 3000) - Frontend with hot module reloading
- **Express backend server** (port 3001) - State persistence for multi-device play

### Alternative Startup Commands
```bash
# Frontend only (no state persistence)
npm run dev:vite

# Backend only
npm run server

# Production build
npm run build
```

## Multi-Device Gameplay

The game supports multiple players on different devices with real-time state synchronization:

1. Start the game and add players on the main device
2. Use QR codes or short URLs (`?p=P1`, `?p=P2`) to connect mobile devices
3. Each player can control their turn from their own device
4. State syncs automatically across all connected devices

**Note:** Backend server (port 3001) is **required** for multi-device features.

## Testing

### Recommended Test Execution
```bash
# Run tests in batches (recommended)
./tests/scripts/run-tests-batch-fixed.sh

# Run specific test suites
npm test tests/services/
npm test tests/components/
npm test tests/E2E-

# Run single test file
npm test tests/services/TurnService.test.tsx
```

**Note:** Running all tests together (`npm test`) may hang due to test isolation issues with module-level mocks. Use batch execution (see [Testing Guide](docs/architecture/TESTING_REQUIREMENTS.md)) for best results.
