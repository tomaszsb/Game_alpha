## 🧹 **Code Audit Recommendations** (March 2026)
*Source: External code audit — high professional quality overall, three risk areas identified*

### 1. Structured CSV columns over parsed text (High Priority)
- [x] Audit all regex-parsing of description text for game logic — 44 operations found across 14 files (Mar 23, 2026)
- [x] Phase 1: CARDS_EXPANDED.csv — added 8 structured columns (card_mechanic, dice ranges, investor_payout), updated EffectFactory + CardService (Mar 23, 2026)
- [x] Phase 2: SPACE_EFFECTS.csv — added `fee_type` column (LOAN_PERCENTAGE, FIXED, DICE_BASED) (Mar 31, 2026)
- [x] Phase 3: DICE_EFFECTS.csv — added `roll_action`, `roll_is_percentage`, `roll_numeric_only` metadata columns (Mar 31, 2026)
- [x] Encapsulate remaining regex — created `src/utils/parseUtils.ts` with 8 reusable utilities, 43 tests (Mar 31, 2026)

### 2. TurnService decomposition (Medium Priority)
- [x] Extract TurnTransitionHandler from `nextPlayer()` — 136 → 27 lines (Mar 23, 2026)
- [x] Extract MovementExecutor from `endTurnWithMovement()` — 153 → ~70 lines (Mar 23, 2026)
- [x] TurnService reduced from 2,148 → 1,984 lines (Mar 23, 2026)
- [x] Stress test MovementExecutor edge cases — 19 tests covering dice/intent/auto-move/edge cases (Mar 31, 2026)

### 3. Dead code cleanup (Medium Priority)
- [x] Remove `PlayerPanel.tsx`, `NextStepButton.tsx`, `PlayerStatusPanel.tsx`, `PlayerStatusItem.tsx`, `TurnControlsWithActions.tsx` and their tests (Mar 22, 2026)
- [x] Deleted MobilePlayerPanel (21 files), CardPortfolioDashboard, MovementPathVisualization, FinancialStatusDisplay, DiceRoller, PlayerViewStateService + 5 test files (Mar 23, 2026)
- [x] Removed dead placeholder UI in GameLayout.tsx (Mar 23, 2026)

## 🎨 **UI Improvements**

### Progress Bar — Financial Overview
- [ ] Add money breakdown visualization to progress bar area
  - Show total project scope as full bar (one color)
  - Overlay with stacked segments: owner money, bank money, investor money

  - Visual indicator of funding gap / surplus

---

## 🔮 **FUTURE: Nice-to-Have Improvements**

### Mobile & PWA
- [ ] App icons (192x192, 512x512) for PWA install
- [ ] Offline support / Service Worker (for poor WiFi venues)
- [ ] Screen orientation lock
- [ ] Skeleton loaders for slow networks
- [ ] Replace emoji icons with icon library (Lucide/Heroicons)

### Testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing with Playwright emulation
