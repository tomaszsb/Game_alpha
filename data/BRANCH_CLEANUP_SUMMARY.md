# Branch Cleanup Summary - November 15, 2025

**Branch:** `claude/cherry-pick-cache-busting-011CUwFMKQdAZGdEnEkpkf6u`
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for PR and merge

---

## Overview

Investigated and cleaned up two unmerged branches that predated the comprehensive movement system refactor (Nov 14, 2025). Extracted valuable commits that were missing from master, plus fixed critical automatic card draw issues discovered during testing.

## Cherry-Picked Commits

### Commit 1: Cache Busting (CRITICAL)
**Original:** `9f32919` from fix-owner-scope-w-cards branch
**Cherry-picked as:** `cc8e4ae`

**What it fixes:**
- Only CARDS_EXPANDED.csv had cache busting
- All other CSV files (MOVEMENT, DICE_EFFECTS, etc.) could serve stale cached data
- This caused game data to be out of sync in production browsers

**Changes:**
- Added `?_=${Date.now()}` cache-busting parameter to ALL 7 CSV file loads
- Files affected:
  - GAME_CONFIG.csv
  - MOVEMENT.csv
  - DICE_OUTCOMES.csv
  - SPACE_EFFECTS.csv
  - DICE_EFFECTS.csv
  - SPACE_CONTENT.csv
  - CARDS_EXPANDED.csv (already had it)

**Impact:** CRITICAL for production - prevents stale CSV data bugs

---

### Commit 2: DICE_EFFECTS Normalization (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Original:** `a15f5ac` from fix-owner-scope-w-cards branch
**Adapted manually as:** `1788485`

**What it fixes:**
- EffectFactory.ts has a switch statement that expects normalized effect types:
  ```typescript
  switch (effect.effect_type) {
    case 'cards':  // ✅ Normalized
    case 'money':  // ✅ Normalized
    case 'time':   // ✅ Normalized
  }
  ```
- But process_remaining_files.py was generating unnormalized types:
  - `effect_type="W Cards"` (should be `"cards"`)
  - `effect_type="Fees Paid"` (should be `"money"`)
  - `effect_type="Time outcomes"` (should be `"time"`)
- This caused dice effects to be **completely ignored** because switch cases wouldn't match

**Changes:**
- Updated `data/process_remaining_files.py` to normalize effect types:
  - `'W Cards'` → `effect_type='cards'`, `card_type='W'`
  - `'Fees Paid'` → `effect_type='money'`, `card_type=''`
  - `'Time outcomes'` → `effect_type='time'`, `card_type=''`

**Impact:** HIGH - dice effects for card drawing, money, and time now work correctly

---

### Commit 3: Automatic Card Draws (CRITICAL - New Fix)
**Created as:** `fa976f0`

**What it fixes:**
- Critical game mechanic where card draws that should be automatic were marked as manual
- Players had to click unnecessary buttons for automatic game events
- Root cause: `process_remaining_files.py` line 114 hardcoded ALL card effects as `'trigger_type': 'manual'`

**Spaces affected:**

**OWNER-FUND-INITIATION (B/I cards):**
- Owner's seed money should auto-draw based on project scope
- Scope ≤ $4M → Auto-draw B card (bank-level funding)
- Scope > $4M → Auto-draw I card (investor-level funding)
- TurnService already had special handling to auto-play these cards
- Now CSV matches the code's expectations

**PM-DECISION-CHECK (L cards):**
- L cards are life surprises from dice rolls
- "Draw 1 if you roll a 1" should trigger automatically
- These are random life events, not user choices
- Now triggers automatically when dice condition met

**Preserved manual behavior:**
- E cards at PM-DECISION-CHECK remain manual (correct - user choice)
- All other manual card draws unchanged

**Changes:**
- Updated `data/process_remaining_files.py` with smart trigger_type detection
- Added space-specific logic to determine auto vs manual
- Regenerated SPACE_EFFECTS.csv with correct trigger types

**Impact:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- Fixes broken automatic funding at OWNER-FUND-INITIATION
- Fixes broken life surprise cards at PM-DECISION-CHECK
- Improves game flow by removing unnecessary manual steps
- Aligns CSV data with game design intent and existing code

## Commits NOT Cherry-Picked

### From fix-owner-scope-w-cards:

#### Commit 6edb8bf - OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION dice-based W cards
**Reason for skipping:** Conflicts with master's design choice
- This branch: OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION draws W cards via dice effects
- Master: OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION has fixed movement → OWNER-FUND-INITIATION
- The comprehensive refactor chose a different game mechanic approach
- Cherry-picking would create gameplay conflicts

#### Commit 2f4a71e - Regenerated DICE_EFFECTS.csv
**Reason for skipping:** Gitignored file, will be regenerated
- public/data files are gitignored (generated files)
- The normalization script change (1788485) will regenerate this automatically
- No need to commit generated CSV files

### From game-movement-csv-system:

#### Commit b93759f - Improved movement CSV processing
**Reason for skipping:** Completely superseded
- This commit improved `data/fix_all_movements.py`
- Final refactor used `data/process_game_data.py` instead
- Both achieved same result (18 dice spaces, fixed movement types)
- Master's approach is more comprehensive (path-first, LOGIC parser)
- No unique value in this commit

## Branch Deletion Status

**Attempted deletion:** Yes
**Status:** ⚠️ Requires GitHub web UI access

Both branches should be deleted via GitHub web interface:
1. `claude/fix-owner-scope-w-cards-011CUv1TXM1LvgdySS9mZ8GG`
2. `claude/game-movement-csv-system-01YVy7nynGXqudrXB1xdmxee`

**Reason:** 403 error when attempting `git push origin --delete` (permissions issue)

---

## Files Modified

### Code Changes
1. `src/services/DataService.ts` - Added cache busting to all CSV loads (7 files)
2. `data/process_remaining_files.py` - Normalized DICE_EFFECTS effect types

### Documentation
1. `data/BRANCH_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This file

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create PR** for branch `claude/cherry-pick-cache-busting-011CUwFMKQdAZGdEnEkpkf6u`
   - Title: "fix: Add cache busting and normalize DICE_EFFECTS types"
   - Description: See this summary document

2. **Merge to master** after PR review/approval

3. **Delete old branches** via GitHub web UI:
   - `claude/fix-owner-scope-w-cards-011CUv1TXM1LvgdySS9mZ8GG`
   - `claude/game-movement-csv-system-01YVy7nynGXqudrXB1xdmxee`

4. **Regenerate CSV files** (if not done automatically):
   ```bash
   cd data
   python3 process_remaining_files.py
   ```

5. **Verify in browser** that CSV files load with cache busting:
   - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Filter: csv
   - Check URLs have `?_=<timestamp>` parameter
   - Verify 200 responses (not 304 Not Modified)

## Impact Assessment

### Critical Fixes Applied ✅
1. **Cache busting:** Prevents production bugs from stale CSV data
2. **DICE_EFFECTS normalization:** Fixes broken dice effects for cards/money/time

### Production Readiness
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No regressions introduced
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean
- ✅ Ready for immediate deployment

### User-Facing Impact
- **Before:** Dice effects for W cards, money, time were ignored (broken)
- **After:** Dice effects work correctly
- **Before:** CSV updates could be cached for hours/days
- **After:** CSV files always load fresh with cache busting

## Lessons Learned

### Pattern: Cherry-Pick from Superseded Branches
When major refactors supersede feature branches:
1. ✅ **DO** investigate commit-by-commit for hidden gems
2. ✅ **DO** cherry-pick specific valuable commits
3. ✅ **DO** test thoroughly after cherry-picking
4. ❌ **DON'T** assume all commits are obsolete
5. ❌ **DON'T** merge entire branches that conflict with refactor

### Critical Insight
The cache busting commit (9f32919) was buried in a branch about W card drawing. It had nothing to do with the main purpose of that branch, but was a critical production fix. This demonstrates the importance of systematic commit-by-commit review.

### Future Recommendation
- Always review unmerged branches before deleting
- Use structured investigation prompts for complex branch analysis
- Document findings even when deleting branches (preserve institutional knowledge)
